[Quiz Generator Demo](https://question-generator-phi.vercel.app/)

The Quiz Generator allows you to randomly create quizzes by importing a CSV file containing a question bank. The CSV must have the following header row:

- **Quiz Title**
- **HTML of the Question**
- **Answer**
- **Options**
- **HTML of the Explanation to the Answer**
- **Question Type**

### Question Types

The _Question Type_ can be one of the following:

- **mc**: Choose the correct answers from the available choices. The answer should be single upper-case alphabet characters, and if more than one answer is correct, separate them with a `|`. The number of options should not exceed 26.

For the HTML of the questions or the explanation, you may simply fill in with the text or with HTML elements, such as `<table>`, `<img>`, etc. Ensure that your images can be found online.

If any of the columns are incorrect in the question row, the quiz will omit the question.

## Handling Escaped `|` in Options

If there is a "|" inside an option, add a "\" before the character to escape it. This code correctly splits options by `|` while handling escaped `|` (`\|` properly).

## Sample Python Code to Generate CSV

This Python script automates the process of logging into a system and extracting quiz questions to generate a CSV file. It uses `Selenium`, a Python library for browser automation, to perform web actions like logging in, selecting modules, and extracting questions.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the required dependencies for the script to run:

1. **Install `selenium` and other dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

2. Dependencies:
   - `selenium` for browser automation.
   - `csv` (standard Python library) for writing the extracted questions to a CSV file.

### Customizing the Script

In the code, you can customise the following variables for your needs:

```
email = "myemail@gmail.com"  # Your login email
password = "mypassword"  # Your login password
url = "http://example.com"  # The URL of the system you're logging into
module = "mymodule"  # The module name you want to select
```

- `email`: Enter your email address here.
- `password`: Enter your password here.
- `url`: Replace the URL with the login page URL of the system you need to access.
- `module`: Set the module name you wish to extract questions from.

### How to Use

1. **Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed and the required dependencies (`selenium`) installed as mentioned above.**
2. **Set up the WebDriver**:
   - Download and install the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).
   - Ensure the WebDriver is accessible from your system PATH.
3. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python generateQuestions.py
   ```

The script will:

1.  Open a web browser using Selenium.
2.  Navigate to the login URL.
3.  Input the email and password to log in.
4.  Accept cookies if prompted.
5.  Select the specified module.
6.  Extract all quiz questions and options.
7.  Write the extracted data to a `questionBank.csv` file.

### Output

After running the script, check the `questionBank.csv` file. It will contain the following columns:

- **Quiz title**: The title of the quiz.
- **HTML of the question**: The complete HTML content of each question.
- **Answer**: The correct single upper-case alphabet answer for the question.
- **Options**: A list of answer options, separated by `|`.
- **HTML of the explanation**: The full HTML content for the explanation of the answer.
- **Question type**: In this case, "mc" for multiple-choice questions.
